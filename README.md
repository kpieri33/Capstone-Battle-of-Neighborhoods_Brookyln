# Capstone-Battle-of-Neighborhoods_Brookyln
My final project for the IBM Applied Data Science professional certificate via Coursera. This project will answer the question of where is the best place to open a Pizza restaurant in Brooklyn. I have clustered the neighborhoods and am looking for clusters where Pizza places are mostly commonly in the top ten. Within that cluster, I will look for a neighborhood that has the lowest visited Pizza place on the list. This will identify an opportunity to start a new Pizza place.
