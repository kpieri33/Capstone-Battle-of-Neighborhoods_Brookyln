# Capstone-Battle-of-Neighborhoods_Brookyln
My final project for the IBM Applied Data Science professional certificate via Coursera. This project will answer the question of where is the best place to open a Pizza restaurant in Brooklyn. I will look at which neighborhoods have a popular restaurant scene but lack Pizzerias.
